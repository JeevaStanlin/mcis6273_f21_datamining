    "### (100%) Perform Bayesian text classification \n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is an important application area of machine learning.  Indeed, the early\n",
    "advances in the field were in text and image processing.  We are now beneficiaries of the\n",
    "libraries and modules that provide us the foundation for a variety of techniques to do\n",
    "sophisticated text analytics and process withuout much effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "With text classification, one goal we might like to accomplish is determine the origin of\n",
    "particular text.  What once used to be the arena of computational linguists and computer\n",
    "scientists, is now growing in [computational digital humanities](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/a-survey-of-digital-humanities-programs/),\n",
    "but is [not without issues](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-digital-humanities-debacle/). In \n",
    "this assignment we are going to use Bayesian techniques to process a corpus, or body of text, with the expressed\n",
    "goal of classifying it.  In fact, we're going to take multiple texts and generate a classifier\n",
    "that (with some work), will be able to distinguish between multiple topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a graduate student, you are fully aware of the extent of academic research represented\n",
    "by the multitude of disciplines in our university community.  You are likely well aware\n",
    "of the many thousands of academic journals that contain the intellectual products of \n",
    "the research in those disciplines. We are going to build a Bayesian classifier that\n",
    "will be trained on the text from abstracts of academic papers, and be able to \n",
    "classify unseen (unlabeled) abstracts into their corresponding disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we are going to keep it simple, mostly just to get you started on \n",
    "the using technique so that you might extend it and learn ways to improve it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laying out the intuition of the technique, let's abstractly think about the problem at hand. An\n",
    "academic discipline usually contains a large domain-specific vocabulary that make it unique \n",
    "relative to\n",
    "other disciplines.  Think of the words in the vocabulary as a \"profile\" (loosely speaking) of the \n",
    "discipline.  More\n",
    "concretely, the probability that computer science papers used a word like \"algorithm\" is much higher than\n",
    "the probability of \"algorithm\" being used in an education paper.  Ultimately with enough examples of the\n",
    "writings of a particular discipline, the easier it would be to establish the probabilities of certain\n",
    "words, phrases and even punctuation usage.  While we are going to choose to classify papers, the\n",
    "same technique could be used to classify authors, for example, classifying texts written  by\n",
    "_Don Knuth_ versus texts authored by _Noam Chomsky_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian techniques are a mainstain in text classification of all kinds, and the ease with which\n",
    "Bayes classifiers can be trained make it a technique that can be fast to implement and get \n",
    "results that are often very accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of time and resouces, we're going to develop a simple Bayesian text classifier to distinguish\n",
    "between the writings of five disciplines: _sociology_, _education_, _physics_, _computer science_ and \n",
    "_economics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under ordinary circumstances we would like to have as many documents from each of these disciplines\n",
    "as possible, and as you might know, obtaining full text documents is often difficult or requires \n",
    "extraction of raw text from PDF documents (that are often only obtained under publisher license or \n",
    "may require payment).  For more information about how extract text from PDFs in\n",
    "Python, please see the [pdfminer.six module](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) as it \n",
    "contains a number of wonderful functionalities to get the text portion of a PDF so it can\n",
    "be processed by more common text and string processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of full text PDF documents, we are lucky in academia to have _abstracts_ which \n",
    "summarize the paper for the reader. These usually paragraph-long text are often enough \n",
    "to get a good idea about the thrust of the paper, and as we have learned in this class\n",
    "_large amounts_ of data are often necessary for any meaningful test of an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In class we talked about test sets, training sets and the permutations we might conduct to\n",
    "get a mix of test/train sets to build supervised learning algorithms.  You are being\n",
    "provided with a small set of testing and training documents for each discipline, and  will use\n",
    "these documents and the provided Jupyter Notebook that step through the process\n",
    "of building the na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier with Sci-Kit Learn's algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have as many documents  as possible -- but in the spirit\n",
    "of time, we will instead use tens of abstracts from each discipline and those\n",
    "will act as the training corpus.  In a more robust classifier training, \n",
    "we will want hundreds or even thousands of abstracts, and as you will see\n",
    "this will impact the results as well as bias the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Processing: A Very Short Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of document classification is the _model_ for document features.  One popular model is\n",
    "the TF-IDF or Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency.  The intuition behind analyzing words in\n",
    "documents hinges on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* terms that are frequent _in documents_ are given higher importance than those that are infrequent,\n",
    "* terms that are frequent _across_ documents are not considered as important;\n",
    "\n",
    "that is _common_ words across an entire corpus are *discounted* while\n",
    "those that are _common_ within documents are *boosted*.  This is an effective way to differentiate since\n",
    "the intuition that the things that make your writing unique are amplified, while those that are not\n",
    "differentiators will count less.\n",
    "\n",
    "To realize the TF-IDF, we will need to break apart the two components TF (or **term frequency**) and\n",
    " IDF (**inverse document frequency**) and then conjoin them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term frequency (TF)** is a simple concept and is exactly as it says: the _counts_ of terms in a document.\n",
    "So for a term (word) $t$ and document $d$, the TF is just the number of occurences of $t$ in $d$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{tf}(t,d) = \\big| t \\in d \\big|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse document frequency (IDF)** provides a way to determine if a terms is rare or\n",
    "common given _all_ documents $D$, and is logarithmically scaled so rare terms avoid completely disappearing.  Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{idf}(t,D) = \\frac{\\big| D \\big|}{ 1 + \\big| \\{t \\in d | d \\in D \\} \\big| }\n",

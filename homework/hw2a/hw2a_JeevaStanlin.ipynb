    "§ Listen to the entire podcast and answer the questions below:\n",
    "1. What was the original idea that Pon tried in 2013?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The original idea that Pon tried in 2013 was putting original intellectual property or NFTs(Non-Fungible Token) in the bitcoin blockchain. But that did not work because bitcoin isn't good for holding NFTs which was later figured out in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Who (or what) did Pon say was the “consumer” of Blockchain and big data? How does this relate to “data mining”?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Pon mentions AI(Artificial Intelligence) as the consumer of Blockchain and Big data. When people share data, they share a source of truth, which could be further mined for insights and Pon realized that though they are working on data mining through blockchains and big data, the actual consumer was AI which was the fastest growing industry in the period of 2015 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Who does Pon say are the gatekeepers of the current “data economy”? How does Ocean Protocol address this?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Pon says that the internet platforms mainly in US and China like Tencent, Alibaba, baidu, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (FANG) , apple, Microsoft, Bloomberg and reuters etc. are the gate keepers of data economy. Data economy is of any economic value that can be created by the use of data, data systems and software. It’s worth trillions as data can be reused and is potentially as valuable as land. So, Ocean Protocol believes that they could build a meaningful framework if the value of the data could be shared amongst people where new internet platforms arise out of data economy where everybody has some power.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does Pon suggest data might be “securitized” over Ocean Protocol? Use the example he gives directly.\n",
    "**Answer:** Pon suggests that data might be “securitized” by turning data streams into value streams. Now, Ocean Protocol has the ability to create ERC20 tokens `(An ERC20 token is a standard used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can then be used to create smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in. ERC stands for \"Ethereum request for comment,\")` using Ocean Technology. So, by buying a data token we can not only access that data stream, but also trade these tokens in a DEX `(a marketplace that connects crypto buyers and sellers)`.V3 of Ocean Technology solves two issues that people have while sharing data, that is losing control over their data and price for the data. V3 provides users with access control for their data as well as a fair market price for their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are the four landscape users (or targets) of Ocean Protocol?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The four landscape users (or targets) of ocean protocol are\n",
    "* 1. Developers\n",
    "* 2. Enterprises\n",
    "* 3. Users\n",
    "* 4. People who are Crypto natives\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What example does he give of a liquid dataset that might have tremendous value in a variety of current and future contexts relating to our world?\n",
    "**Answer:** The example that Pon gives is Atmospheric data. If we have a temperature data that anybody can access where people are incentivized to keep it fresher and updated even in places that are so remote, we can get a complete view of atmospheric conditions for climate researchers to get a better idea of how global warming is affecting us. Imagine a climate token or carbon token that you can earn for making quality of data about climate or carbon in air better. If the data is being used up, then the data provider will be incentivized. Thus the current financial system is used to work on things that matter to the world such as climate change, global poverty and global health and people can make money out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What does Pon predict the crypto marketplace will look like in 10 years?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Pon predicts that in 10 years, there will be probably a couple hundred billion dollar companies built on top of crypto. He also says, Crypto itself will be completely decentralized but companies like coinbase, binance, some nft data companies worth billions probably to the size of the internet is going to happen much faster on a much larger scale because from the very start blockchain has been global, whereas internet started in San Fransisco.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After consuming this podcast, please list your reaction to it in a short paragraph of at a minimum of three complete sentences. Address what you already know about crypto and the data economy as well as the things that you learned that were new knowledge. You may also address whether you agree or disagree with Pon’s positions, especially how it relates to Ocean Protocol and cryptocurrencies, in general, becoming a great equalizer. You can also include any personal experiences you have with the technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "This podcast is loaded with information about crypto world. Data economy though exists for several years now, the idea of how it's done is a blind side to still a lot of people. I have very little knowledge about crypto, blockchains and data economy, but this podcast was a great start to learn more about it. I learned lot of new terms and was able to sense what the world is heading towards in terms of financial transactions and how faster it's happening. Though Pon talks about data security through Ocean protocol, I still could not imagine how private data can be traded without affecting privacy. "

    "&#167;  Listen to the entire podcast and answer the questions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the definition of ML Ops according to Ms. Hsiao? Including in your answer where the intersection of ML Ops.</br>\n",
    "ML Ops stands for Machine learning Operations. According to Ms. Hsiao, the purpose of ML Ops today is to get your processes and tools that keeps ML up and running in production environments in a safe and efficient way. She also envisions ML Ops as an elaborate dance between data science and IT Ops with a shared goal of continuously keeping the systems up and running in a changing environment in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does the analogy of baking versus cooking related to the conversation on ML Ops?</br>\n",
    "While talking about the amount of the automation required, CPM comes up with this analogy of baking vs cooking. When thinking of baking, there is a set of instructions that needs to be followed with no or very little observation to get the desired dish, whereas in cooking, there can be changes in the amount of ingredients based on taste, seasoning and it can be little different every time. There is always human intervention required in cooking. Similarly, in ML Ops, system can be automated to follow certain instructions and get the desired output just like baking. But when the input changes, there is a little bit of human intervention needed to get the desired output like cooking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide information about the example given where when the “cook” or subject matter experts had to come in and manually validate model output. Include a discussion of cost benefit analysis against false negatives.</br>\n",
    "The example given is about a company handling very sensitive personal information of certain banking clients for fraud analytics. There were subject matter experts analyzing the patterns and behaviors of those clients online and some automated models that analyzed the behavior of the clients. It involved human effort and some automation. In the automation part, a model was built where feedback is taken from SME on a daily basis where he would be given about 10 or 15 different accounts to analyze based on the team’s time, money and effort. The feedback is then passed again through the model for adjustments and human intervention is needed to close any bank account. Here the cost benefit analysis is considered for the human intervention to identify false positives or false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What was one of the problems Christina identified in oil and gas domain expertise? How is it being addressed? </br>\n",
    "One of the main problems Christina identified in oil and gas domain expertise was aging out of the workforce. The people in the industry with all the domain knowledge are retiring and the knowledge gained by these people over years could be lost. Now they are finding ways to encode these knowledge into pipelines so that young people who get into the job, need not require that long time to gain expertise in that area. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Christina argues against “humanization” in MLOps. What does she suggest instead? </br>\n",
    "Humans don’t have time to sit and watch every drift in the input or output. But setting a threshold like 5% from a reference baseline and giving an alert when there is a drift could help. Now it’s automated, not replacing humans but a smart way to save time and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. According to Christina, what is the goal of MLOps in the Data Science landscape? </br>\n",
    "According to Christina, the goal of ML Ops is to find a way free up the data Scientists so that they can use their resources to innovate on new things. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write two or three sentences about your reaction to this podcast.</br>\n",
    "This podcast has beautifully described the importance of human intervention in a smart way in addition to automation of models (AI) to improve the efficiency and performance of the systems. Christina has a lot of wisdom on this ML Ops area and her points are so valid.\n",

    "&#167;  Read the entire paper and answer the questions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is conceptual vagueness a problem in the ethical guidelines reviewed by the authors?</br>\n",
    "The lack of clarity and difference in the ethical guidelines for developing and implementing AI systems by different organizations that are not even close to the precision that would allow any comparison and exploration is the problem. This vagueness was not only identified across organizations’ guidelines, but also within the same proposed guideline. \n",
    "\n",
    " 2. What are the eleven ethical principles the authors identify as important concepts in any ethical framework?</br>\n",
    "The eleven ethical principles that the authors identified are as follows: 1. Transparency 2. Justice and Fairness 3. Non-Maleficence 4. Responsibility 5. Privacy 6. Beneficence 7. Freedom & Autonomy 8. Trust 9. Sustainability 10. Dignity 11. Solidarity</br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    " 3. What is IoF? Please detail as many components of IoF as identified in the paper. </br>\n",
    "IoF means Internet of Food. It is a concept envisioned by Leone’s paper as a set of sophisticated communication and digital services between machines, consumers and companies to provide information about nearly all food ingredients and products. This not only involves food recommendation but also involves monitoring and executing steps in the food production via the combination of advanced sensory applications, advanced methods for collecting and interpreting data, and automation to the creation of digital information platforms based on which AI systems can give personalized recommendations to the consumer.\n",
    ".\n",
    "4. How do the authors say Food Recommender Systems (F-RS) are different from other recommender systems, and why do the authors think that difference is important? Do you agree with their critique?</br>\n",
    "The authors say that Food Recommender Systems (F-RS) are different from other recommender systems in terms of personalization and domain-restriction. F-RS is based on shared preferences mostly defined by the creator, without personalization and it is not domain-restricted. I definitely agree with their critique as food preferences are most commonly shared preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. In terms of autonomy and personal identity, the authors mention the concept of “informed consent” when entering a business relationship. Explain why you agree or disagree with their statement that “[a customer relationship] should entail the awareness about how the other party is compensated for the services they provide”. You should be as descriptive as possible when stating your position. Use examples from the paper if you wish. </br>\n",
    "Considering any food recommender system, it would have a goal of building up revenue by keeping their users on their platform as long as possible either by selling their data or advertisements. By the concept of “informed consent”, the users as part of the system are entitled to know how the other party is generating revenue through the services the recommender system provides. I think it is very important to have an ethical agenda and compensation aspect that should be viewed side by side. If the F-RS platforms are getting compensated through advertisements on the platform, they should inform the users how they maintain ethical values and how the user data is used as part of their compensation agenda. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why do you think defining the non-ethically motivated parts of an algorithm (section 3.5.2) are important in theory, but difficult to actually implement. </br>\n",
    "Defining non-ethically motivated are important in theory. It involves defining the purpose and consequences of the recommendation and show how several variables are optimized to bring the recommendation to the user. But it is actually very difficult to make the recommendation algorithm explicitly understandable by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In section 3.7 “Polarisation and Social Manipulabilty”, the authors suggest that “Attracting as many users as possible behind an ethical agenda seems easier if the stress is put on a catchy buzzword” . . . and “. . . we need stakeholders who truly commit to their values and promote their intrepretation and implementation”. How might transparency improve the gap that emerges between what companies say about their product and what is true in what they are actually doing? Could you conceive of a way blockchain technology might help? </br>\n",
    "The authors sense that, rather than interpretation of the values mentioned as a buzzword in a product, attracting more users using the buzzword for name sake is another challenge for effective Food Recommendation Systems. This also spoils the quality of the food industry as well. So a transparent system can improve this gap. \n",
    "The emerging blockchain technology might help in maintaining the transparency of the food system.\n",
    "For example, if a consumer wants to buy organic tomato ketchup, they rely on the label claim. The manufacturer of ketchup relies on the supplier of tomato puree or concentrate processor. The tomato processor relies on the claim/organic certification furnished by the farmer or farmer association. If any of the participants provide a false claim, both the consumers and other participants are cheated.\n",
    "Blockchain provides a secure environment where each of the participants in the blockchain network has access to each data and these data, once entered and verified, cannot be modified. For example, a farmer that provides an organic food certificate, which is verified by an authorised agency, cannot have that certificate tampered with at later date. \n",
    "Ref: https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/article/110116/blockchain/\n",
    "\n",
    "8. List the product assessment criticisms the authors lodge against the Yuka application. Why do they feel the inclusion of “organic” as a criterion for recommendation is problematic? </br>\n",
    "Yuka is a food recommender app. Yuka relies on three elements for their scoring : (i) the score a product gets from Nutriscore [12], (ii) the presence of additives in the products, and (iii) if the product is organic. Yuka automatically gives an extra 10% score to any organic product despite the fact that the positive effects of organic products on the human health are still subject to scientific debate. Yuka also make their recommendation based on a combined ratio of these factors,  60% for Nutriscore, 30% for the existence of certain additives and 10% if the product is organic. According to the authors, there are more important things to be made clear for the user, who are the natural persons behind this calculation? What makes them reliable? Are they qualified to make such an assessment?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Why are the crowdsourced databases that Yuka rely on a problem for the authors? </br>\n",
    "Crowdsourced databases might have erroneous and outdated input. Manufacturers are allowed to change the ingredients of the products without necessarily changing the bar code. The information is not legitimate and there is no accountability and transparency in crowdsourced databases. That becomes a problem of ethical values in food recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Explainability and Fairness are two issues that the authors criticize Yuka heavily for. What do you think the Yuka designers could do to address the authors’ concerns? </br>\n",
    "Whenever Yuka recommends an alternative based on product availability but not based on its ranking, it lacks explainability. The app could let their users know why it recommends a product ith a low score as an alternative to a healthy product.\n",
    "Lack of transparency makes it impossible to be validated, there is no fairness when it comes to recommendations (as it recommends a product with score below 50 just for product availability), and it is doubtful how the product availability is carefully calculated.\n",
    "All these concerns should be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Write a three to five sentence reaction to this paper. Include in your reaction whether you thought the authors were objective? Did they clearly communicate the goals of the paper? Were they successful in accomplishing those goals? Do you agree or disagree with one or more points in the paper? How would you suggest improvements to the paper if you were a reviewer or reader?</br>\n",
    "This is really a good read. Often times, as consumers we don’t think much of the ethical perspective of food recommendations. The authors have successfully digged deeper into this topic and brought some valuable points. The Yuka case study gave a picture of all the concepts the authors discussed. \n",
